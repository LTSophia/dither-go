# TODO

### Fundamentals

- [ ] Finalize README and make a project description
- [x] Write functions to load and save image files
- [x] Write helper for creating color.RGBA objects, to avoid nil dereferencing
- [x] Write helper for creating palette slice, as Gopy doesn't have abstraction for slice of objects
- [x] Support popular image formats (decode and encode):
    - [x] PNG
    - [x] JPEG
    - [x] WebP
    - [x] TIFF (mostly for previews)
    - [x] GIF (static)
    - [x] BMP
- [ ] ~~Override the whole `pixelmappers` module, as Gopy ignores methods that has return type set as type signature~~ Moved to `dither-gopy`
- [ ] ~~Support for image manipulation (ideally support native Python libraries, like PIL)~~ There isn't any sufficient way to transport binary data between Go and Python yet. Library users will simply have to apply additional effects before dithering

### Multi-arch support:
- [ ] Be able to generate wheels for multiple architectures and platforms

<details>
<summary>Here's how this will be structured:</summary>
In this repository, the bindings, a wrapper and everything needed to pack this mess into a usable library package will be stored.<br><br>

`dither_go` will contain a `x86_64-linux-gnu` copy of bindings already generated (and updated by some small workflow), in order to run test workflows in future.<br>
Bindings for other architectures and platforms will be generated by `build_wheel` workflow which (using `setup.py`) will override inside a wheel base bindings with those for targeted arch/platform.
</details>

### In v1.0

- [ ] Write more tests and examples
- [ ] Generate documentation
- [ ] Make bindings fully MyPy compliant
- [ ] Override `Config` suffixed and `ErrorDiffusionMatrix.Offset()` functions
- [ ] Create an exception system. Functions in Go will return error code and optional error message, and Python wrapper will raise an adequate exception if it receives them
- [ ] Support additional image formats:
    - [ ] JXL
    - [ ] AVIF
    - [ ] HEIC/HEIF
    - [ ] (maybe?; only decode) SVG
